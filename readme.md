# **Clean Node API**

[Leia-me em PortuguÃªs (Brasil)](./readme-pt_BR.md)

This API is part of Rodrigo Manguinho's training at Udemy.

The objective of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) as a working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
